# Predicting High Potential Employees in a Corporate

## Project Idea

Employees are the key resources of the organization. The success or failure of an organization depends on the employee. Most of the organizations or companies have a formal performance evaluation system in which employee job performance is graded on a regular basis, usually once or twice a year. A good performance evaluation system can prominently benefit an organization. It helps employee behaviour toward organizational aims by permitting employees to know what is expected for them, and it yields information for making employment decisions, such as those regarding pay raises, promotion, or releases.
